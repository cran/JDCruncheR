With the current version of the JDCruncheR package (`r utils::packageVersion("JDCruncheR")`), you can:

- easily launch the JDemetra+ cruncher ([JWSACruncher](https://github.com/jdemetra/jwsacruncher/releases)) to update a workspace and export the results;  
- generate a *quality report* to synthesise seasonal adjustment diagnostics. It can be used to spot the most problematic series which will require a finer analysis. This is most useful when dealing with a great number of series, which renders impossible the examination of every diagnostic for every series in a reasonable time. 

# About the cruncher

To prevent the package from being too voluminous, it does not contain the JDemetra+ cruncher. Said cruncher can be downloaded here: <https://github.com/jdemetra/jdemetra-app/releases>. For more information on the cruncher installation and its set up with a portable version of Java, please refer to the JDCruncheR wiki: <https://github.com/InseeFr/JDCruncheR/wiki/Installation-&-configuration>.

The JDemetra+ cruncher requires three elements to function:

- a settings file containing the refresh policy parameters to apply to the workspace;  
- a valid JDemetra+ workspace;  
- the path to the cruncher directory.

In the JDCruncheR package, three functions are cruncher-related:  

- `create_param_file()` generates a settings file;  
- `cruncher()` crunches a workspace from a pre-generated settings file;  
- `cruncher_and_param()` both generates the settings file and crunches the workspace. With this function, some of the cruncher output can also be customised.

# Generating the settings file with `create_param_file()`

The arguments of the function `create_param_file()` are described in the JDemetra+ cruncher wiki (<https://github.com/jdemetra/jwsacruncher/wiki>). The three main arguments are:  

1. `policy`, the refresh policy:

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# nolint start line_length_linter
refresh_policy <- structure(
    list(

        Description = c(
            "The ARIMA model, outliers and other regression variables are not re-identified, and the values of all associated coefficients are fixed.

2. `matrix_item`, a list containing the names of the parameters to export. By default, such names are those contained in the `default_matrix_item` option. Thus, the user can either modify the `default_matrix_item` option or the `matrix_item` option:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
library("JDCruncheR")
# To see the default parameters:
getOption("default_matrix_item")
# To customise the parameter selection (here, only the information criteria are exported):
options(default_matrix_item = c(
    "likelihood.aic",
    "likelihood.aicc",
    "likelihood.bic",
    "likelihood.bicc"
))
```

3. `tsmatrix_series`, a list containing the names of the parameters to export. By default, such names are those contained in the `default_tsmatrix_series` option. Thus, the user can either modify the `default_tsmatrix_series` option or the  `tsmatrix_series` option:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# To see the default parameters:
getOption("default_tsmatrix_series")
# To customise the parameter selection (here, only the seasonaly adjusted series and its previsions are exported):
options(default_tsmatrix_series = c("sa", "sa_f"))
```

To visualise all parameters that can be used to customise these options, enter `?create_param_file` (in R).


Here are some use cases for the function `create_param_file()`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# A .param parameters file will be created in D:/, containing the "lastoutliers" refresh policy
# and default values for the other parameters
create_param_file(
    dir_file_param = "D:/",
    policy = "lastoutliers"
)

# To customise the "default_matrix_item" and "default_tsmatrix_series" options
# to only export the information criteria, the adjusted series and its forecast:
create_param_file(
    dir_file_param = "D:/",
    policy = "lastoutliers",
    matrix_item = c(
        "likelihood.aic", "likelihood.aicc",
        "likelihood.bic", "likelihood.bicc"
    ),
    tsmatrix_series = c("sa", "sa_f")
)
```



# Launching the cruncher

To crunch a workspace with the functions `cruncher()` or `cruncher_and_param()`, the paths to the cruncher and the workspace must be specified via two parameters, `cruncher_bin_directory` and `workspace`.

Once declared, the path to the cruncher (stored in the parameter `cruncher_bin_directory`) is valid for all cruncher executions. The path must refer to the *jwsacruncher.bat* file location, within the "bin" installation folder. For example, if the cruncher is installed in `D:\jdemetra-cli-2.2.3`, the *jwsacruncher.bat* file will be in `D:\jdemetra-cli-2.2.3\bin`. The code to declare this path via the `cruncher_bin_directory` parameter is:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
options(cruncher_bin_directory = "D:/jdemetra-cli-2.2.3/bin/")
```

If no path to a workspace was specified, a window opens for a manual workspace selection.

The function `cruncher_and_param()` creates a temporary parameters file by calling `create_param_file()`, which is then used to by the function `cruncher()` to crunch the workspace. In addition to the parameters used by these two functions, `cruncher_and_param()` carries the option `rename_multi_documents` with which the output folders can be renamed after the SAProcessings' names as displayed in the JDemetra+ interface (by default, `rename_multi_documents = TRUE`: the output files are renamed). Here are some use cases:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Code to update the "ipi" workspace stored in D:/seasonal_adjustment/, with the refresh policy "lastoutliers".
# All other create_param_file() parameters are default ones. In particular, the exported parameters are the default
# "default_matrix_item" and "default_tsmatrix_series", and the output folder is D:/seasonal_adjustment/Output/.
cruncher_and_param(
    workspace = "D:/seasonal_adjustment/ipi.xml",
    rename_multi_documents = FALSE,
    policy = "lastoutliers"
)

# Example of customisation of the parameter "output":
cruncher_and_param(
    workspace = "D:/seasonal_adjustment/ipi.xml",
    output = "D:/cruncher_results/",
    rename_multi_documents = FALSE,
    policy = "lastoutliers"
)

# Here, we explicitely have "rename_multi_documents = TRUE" (which is also the default value) to rename the ouput folders
# after the SAProcessings as displayed in the JDemetra+ interface.
# With parameter "delete_existing_file = TRUE", all pre-existing versions of such folders are deleted before the export.
cruncher_and_param(
    workspace = "D:/Campagne_CVS/ipi.xml",
    rename_multi_documents = TRUE,
    delete_existing_file = TRUE,
    policy = "lastoutliers"
)

# To see all the function parameters:
?cruncher_and_param
```
